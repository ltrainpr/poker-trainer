      - What's my current hand? (meaning what's my highest hand)
      - How many full outs to next highest hand?

    - Program randomly selects type of player depending on probability to encounter that player on limit holdem (tight_passive: 20%, loose_passive: 20%, tight_agressive: 50%, loose_aggressive: 10%)
    - The earlier a playerâ€™s position in the betting order, the narrower the range of hands he is probably holding.

  - Which hand beats that range?
  - How many outs do I have to the hand that beats that range?
